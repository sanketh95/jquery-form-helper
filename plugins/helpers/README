This file gives you a step-wise proceduring to develop new form helpers.

USAGE:
In order to add a new form helper :
1)Create a file <helpername>.js in thiss directory.
2)In this file add the following snippet.

form_helpers.add_helper(hname,function(inpel){
//Inpel is the input element to which this helper needs to be applied.
//fname is the name of the helper function. Can be anything you like but
//needs to be called with the same name.
});

I have created a separate folder for adding new mobile helpers.So please add new mobile heplers in the mobile_localization folder.
In order to add a new mobile helper i.e, a helper for mobile numbers of a new country:
1)Create a file <helpername>.js in mobile_localization directory.
2)In the file add the following snippet

form_helpers.mobile_localization.add(fname,function(inpel){

//Inpel is the input element to which this helper needs to be applied.
//fname is the name of the helper function. Can be anything you like but 
//needs to be called with the same name.

});
